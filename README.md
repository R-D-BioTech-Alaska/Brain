# Brain

*Update 12/27/2025* - Brain has been released with a lot of bugs, mostly due to Quantum addons. Currently I am not experiencing issues with it, so if you use it, please open PR's with any issues.

*Update 12/19/2025* - Brain is being combined with Qelm.

This is the future home of Brain.

Brain is in a concept phase with a few projects in the works. Brains concept is a Nueral brain like structure that runs on quantum bits and quantum simulators. Brain will be able to process information in real time and encode it to qubit groupings with specialized architecture.
